# Mosiah 4: How Gratitude Transforms Us and Opens Our Hands

> "And ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain" - Mosiah 4:16

## Becoming Saints

Mosiah chapter four contains the teachings of King Benjamin on how we can become saints. A saint is a holy one. That is what it literally means, not THE holy one, but a holy one. An imperfect representation of Christ, a reflection of His divine light in our daily lives.

King Benjamin's sermon is remarkable not just for what it teaches, but for what it emphasizes. Scholar James Faulconer notes that "in terms of word count, slightly more than sixty percent of the words in this discussion of the fruits of repentance are about how we respond to the beggar and others in need. Clearly this is an important topic for Benjamin" ([Mosiah: A Brief Theological Introduction, 70](https://www.amazon.com/Mosiah-Brief-Theological-Introduction-Introduction/dp/1948218723)).

Sixty percent. Benjamin could have spent his final sermon on doctrine, on prophecy, on any other number of commandments. Instead, he spent the majority of his words on one question: What will you do when a beggar asks you for help?

## The If/Then: Belief Transforms Desire

Benjamin's teaching follows a clear pattern. It starts with belief—real, foundational belief about who God is:

> Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.

[Source: Mosiah 4:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng)

This isn't just intellectual assent. Benjamin is calling us to truly know God: His power, His wisdom, His goodness. And then he adds something crucial in verse 11: we must "remember, and always retain in remembrance, the greatness of God, and your own nothingness, and his goodness and long-suffering towards you."

I think one of the central purposes of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is to change our nature and our desires. Not just our actions, but what we want to do. I've never killed anyone or gotten into a physical fight, but that doesn't mean a part of me has never wanted to hurt someone. The gospel doesn't aim to only restrain bad behavior, it transforms the desires themselves.

When we truly believe in God and remember His goodness, Benjamin promises specific changes in our lives. These changes radiate outward in three spheres:

### Personal Transformation (verses 12-13)

> And behold, I say unto you that if ye do this ye shall always rejoice, and be filled with the love of God, and always retain a remission of your sins; and ye shall grow in the knowledge of the glory of him that created you, or in the knowledge of that which is just and true.
> 
> And ye will not have a mind to injure one another, but to live peaceably, and to render to every man according to that which is his due.

[Source: Mosiah 4:12-13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng)

Notice verse 13: "ye will not have a mind to injure one another." Not just that you won't injure others, but that you won't even want to. The desire itself changes. You'll want to live peaceably. You'll want to give people what they're due.

### Family Impact (verses 14-15)

> And ye will not suffer your children that they go hungry, or naked; neither will ye suffer that they transgress the laws of God, and fight and quarrel one with another, and serve the devil...
> 
> But ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; ye will teach them to love one another, and to serve one another.

[Source: Mosiah 4:14-15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng)

The transformation doesn't stop with us. It flows into our families. We care for our children's physical and spiritual needs. We teach them truth, love, and service because our own transformation makes us want to raise them this way.

### Societal Change (verses 16-17)

> And also, ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need of your succor; ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain, and turn him out to perish.

[Source: Mosiah 4:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng)

This is where Benjamin spends most of his words. The personal transformation and family impact are important, but they lead somewhere: to a society where no one is left behind, where beggars are not ignored, where we give of our substance to those in need.

The beauty of the Gospel is that these changes don't stop with us. They ripple outward, first changing us, then our families, then our entire society.

## We Are All Beggars

King Benjamin anticipates an objection that many of us have felt:

> Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may not suffer, for his punishments are just—

[Source: Mosiah 4:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng)

He brought it on himself. He made bad choices. Why should I help someone who won't help themselves?

Benjamin's answer is simple: because you are a beggar too.

> For behold, are we not all beggars? Do we not all depend upon the same Being, even God, for all the substance which we have, for both food and raiment, and for gold, and for silver, and for all the riches which we have of every kind?

[Source: Mosiah 4:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng)

None of us can save ourselves. We are all completely dependent on God's grace, His mercy, His long-suffering. Every breath we take is a gift. Every good thing we have comes from Him. We are all beggars before God, hoping He will not turn us away.

When we truly understand this, when we remember our own spiritual poverty, it becomes impossible to look down on those who are physically poor. How can we judge someone for their need when we ourselves are in desperate need of God's grace?

## Three Categories, One Command

Benjamin acknowledges that we're all in different economic situations. He describes three categories (Mosiah 4:23-24):

**The Rich** - Those who have more than enough, who have abundance to share

**The Poor** - Those who have just enough for each day, whose substance is barely sufficient

**The Beggar** - Those who do not have enough and must ask for help

Most of us probably fall into the first category. We may not feel "rich," but we have food, shelter, clothing, and usually much more. Benjamin's command applies to all of us, regardless of category: give according to what you have.

For those with abundance, give generously. For those with little, give what you can, even if it's just refusing to judge those who ask. And if you find yourself in the beggar category, know that your worth isn't diminished, and better days can come.

## The Question That Haunts Me

So what are we supposed to do? I pay my tithing every month faithfully. I try to be a good person. But is it enough?

Then I encountered this quote from C.S. Lewis:

> "Charity—giving to the poor—is an essential part of Christian morality. . . . I do not believe one can settle on how much we ought to give. I am afraid the only safe rule is to give more than we can spare. In other words, if . . . our charities do not at all pinch or hamper us, I should say they are too small. There ought to be things we should like to do and cannot because our charitable expenditure excludes them."

[Source: C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity, p. 82](https://www.amazon.com/Mere-Christianity-C-S-Lewis/dp/0060652926)

This quote hurt to read. It still hurts. Because when I look at my life honestly, my charitable giving doesn't "pinch" at all. I think about the pile of shoes in my room, shoes I've worn a few times and forgotten about. The closet full of clothes I don't think about. My multiple computers. My car. All these things.

I'm not hurting financially. In fact, I often find myself wanting more. Sometimes I tell myself it's for saving for the future. Other times I promise I'll do good with my money later, when I have more of it.

But Lewis's words expose that rationalization. If my giving doesn't exclude things I'd like to do, then I'm not giving enough.

## The Paralysis of Perfectionism

When I first felt the conviction of Lewis's words, I fell into a familiar cycle:

**Guilt** → I'm not doing enough, I'm living in excess while others suffer

**Perfectionism** → I need to give everything! I need to completely change my lifestyle!

**Overwhelm** → I can't do that, it's impossible, I can't change everything at once

**Nothing** → I do nothing because I can't do everything

This cycle is insidious. Guilt without action becomes paralysis. Perfectionism becomes the enemy of good. I wait for the perfect moment, the perfect amount to give, the perfect plan, and in the meantime, I do nothing.

## Perfect Is the Enemy of Good

But during this reading of Mosiah 4, a thought came to me: I don't have to be perfect to start.

I cannot be perfect. My pride and my worldly desires are in the way. I cannot uproot them all at once. But what can I do? Something good, at least.

Joseph B. Wirthlin taught:

> "The [next] thing we can do to live in thanksgiving daily is open our arms. One of the best ways we show our gratitude is by blessing the lives of those around us. When was the last time you unselfishly reached out to help another in need? Every time we cheer another's heart, every time we ease another's burden, every time we lift a weary hand, we show our gratitude to that God to whom we owe all that we have and all that we are."

[Source: Joseph B. Wirthlin, "Live in Thanksgiving Daily" BYU Devotional 31 October 2000](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/joseph-b-wirthlin/live-in-thanksgiving-daily/)

Gratitude opens our arms. Remembering God's goodness to us makes us want to bless others. And I can start small.

## My 1% Commitment

I chose to start where my weakness allows: 1% of my income.

It's not perfect. It's probably not even "pinching" the way Lewis describes. But it's something. It's action instead of paralysis. It's good instead of perfect.

I created a 1% page on this blog where I track every donation I make and the claimed impact of those donations. It's my accountability tool, my way of saying "I'm doing something, even if it's imperfect."

This isn't the end goal. It's the starting line. But sometimes starting imperfectly is better than waiting forever to start perfectly.

## The Ongoing Transformation

King Benjamin's teaching is about transformation—the kind that starts with belief in God, grows through gratitude for His goodness, and manifests in opened hands toward those in need.

The personal changes (joy, love, remission of sins) lead to family changes (teaching our children truth and service) which lead to societal changes (caring for the poor and the beggar). It's a pattern that flows from the inside out, from the heart to the hands.

I'm still on this journey. My closet still has too many clothes. My charitable giving still doesn't pinch the way it probably should. But I'm not waiting for perfection anymore. I'm starting with 1%, with action, with something good.

Because in the end, Benjamin's question still stands: When the beggar puts up his petition to you, will you turn him away? Or will you remember that you too are a beggar before God, hoping for His mercy?

## Reflection

What could you start doing today, even imperfectly? Where does good triumph over perfect in your life?
