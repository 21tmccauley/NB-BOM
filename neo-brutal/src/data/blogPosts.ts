# Mosiah 4: How Gratitude Transforms Us and Opens Our Hands

> "And ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain" - Mosiah 4:16

## Becoming Saints

Mosiah chapter four contains the teachings of King Benjamin on how we can become saints. A saint is a holy one. That is what it literally means, not THE holy one, but a holy one. An imperfect representation of Christ, a reflection of His divine light in our daily lives.

King Benjamin's sermon is remarkable not just for what it teaches, but for what it emphasizes. Scholar James Faulconer notes that "in terms of word count, slightly more than sixty percent of the words in this discussion of the fruits of repentance are about how we respond to the beggar and others in need. Clearly this is an important topic for Benjamin" ([Mosiah: A Brief Theological Introduction, 70](https://www.amazon.com/Mosiah-Brief-Theological-Introduction-Introduction/dp/1948218723)).

Sixty percent. Benjamin could have spent his final sermon on doctrine, on prophecy, on any other number of commandments. Instead, he spent the majority of his words on one question: What will you do when a beggar asks you for help?

## The If/Then: Belief Transforms Desire

Benjamin's teaching follows a clear pattern. It starts with belief—real, foundational belief about who God is:

> Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.

[Source: Mosiah 4:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng)

This isn't just intellectual assent. Benjamin is calling us to truly know God: His power, His wisdom, His goodness. And then he adds something crucial in verse 11: we must "remember, and always retain in remembrance, the greatness of God, and your own nothingness, and his goodness and long-suffering towards you."

I think one of the central purposes of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is to change our nature and our desires. Not just our actions, but what we want to do. I've never killed anyone or gotten into a physical fight, but that doesn't mean a part of me has never wanted to hurt someone. The gospel doesn't aim to only restrain bad behavior, it transforms the desires themselves.

When we truly believe in God and remember His goodness, Benjamin promises specific changes in our lives. These changes radiate outward in three spheres:

### Personal Transformation (verses 12-13)

> And behold, I say unto you that if ye do this ye shall always rejoice, and be filled with the love of God, and always retain a remission of your sins; and ye shall grow in the knowledge of the glory of him that created you, or in the knowledge of that which is just and true.
> 
> And ye will not have a mind to injure one another, but to live peaceably, and to render to every man according to that which is his due.

[Source: Mosiah 4:12-13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng)

Notice verse 13: "ye will not have a mind to injure one another." Not just that you won't injure others, but that you won't even want to. The desire itself changes. You'll want to live peaceably. You'll want to give people what they're due.

### Family Impact (verses 14-15)

> And ye will not suffer your children that they go hungry, or naked; neither will ye suffer that they transgress the laws of God, and fight and quarrel one with another, and serve the devil...
> 
> But ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; ye will teach them to love one another, and to serve one another.

[Source: Mosiah 4:14-15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng)

The transformation doesn't stop with us. It flows into our families. We care for our children's physical and spiritual needs. We teach them truth, love, and service because our own transformation makes us want to raise them this way.

### Societal Change (verses 16-17)

> And also, ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need of your succor; ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain, and turn him out to perish.

[Source: Mosiah 4:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng)

This is where Benjamin spends most of his words. The personal transformation and family impact are important, but they lead somewhere: to a society where no one is left behind, where beggars are not ignored, where we give of our substance to those in need.

The beauty of the Gospel is that these changes don't stop with us. They ripple outward, first changing us, then our families, then our entire society.

## We Are All Beggars

King Benjamin anticipates an objection that many of us have felt:

> Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may not suffer, for his punishments are just—

[Source: Mosiah 4:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng)

He brought it on himself. He made bad choices. Why should I help someone who won't help themselves?

Benjamin's answer is simple: because you are a beggar too.

> For behold, are we not all beggars? Do we not all depend upon the same Being, even God, for all the substance which we have, for both food and raiment, and for gold, and for silver, and for all the riches which we have of every kind?

[Source: Mosiah 4:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng)

None of us can save ourselves. We are all completely dependent on God's grace, His mercy, His long-suffering. Every breath we take is a gift. Every good thing we have comes from Him. We are all beggars before God, hoping He will not turn us away.

When we truly understand this, when we remember our own spiritual poverty, it becomes impossible to look down on those who are physically poor. How can we judge someone for their need when we ourselves are in desperate need of God's grace?

## Three Categories, One Command

Benjamin acknowledges that we're all in different economic situations. He describes three categories (Mosiah 4:23-24):

**The Rich** - Those who have more than enough, who have abundance to share

**The Poor** - Those who have just enough for each day, whose substance is barely sufficient

**The Beggar** - Those who do not have enough and must ask for help

Most of us probably fall into the first category. We may not feel "rich," but we have food, shelter, clothing, and usually much more. Benjamin's command applies to all of us, regardless of category: give according to what you have.

For those with abundance, give generously. For those with little, give what you can, even if it's just refusing to judge those who ask. And if you find yourself in the beggar category, know that your worth isn't diminished, and better days can come.

## The Question That Haunts Me

So what are we supposed to do? I pay my tithing every month faithfully. I try to be a good person. But is it enough?

Then I encountered this quote from C.S. Lewis:

> "Charity—giving to the poor—is an essential part of Christian morality. . . . I do not believe one can settle on how much we ought to give. I am afraid the only safe rule is to give more than we can spare. In other words, if . . . our charities do not at all pinch or hamper us, I should say they are too small. There ought to be things we should like to do and cannot because our charitable expenditure excludes them."

[Source: C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity, p. 82](https://www.amazon.com/Mere-Christianity-C-S-Lewis/dp/0060652926)

This quote hurt to read. It still hurts. Because when I look at my life honestly, my charitable giving doesn't "pinch" at all. I think about the pile of shoes in my room, shoes I've worn a few times and forgotten about. The closet full of clothes I don't think about. My multiple computers. My car. All these things.

I'm not hurting financially. In fact, I often find myself wanting more. Sometimes I tell myself it's for saving for the future. Other times I promise I'll do good with my money later, when I have more of it.

But Lewis's words expose that rationalization. If my giving doesn't exclude things I'd like to do, then I'm not giving enough.

## The Paralysis of Perfectionism

When I first felt the conviction of Lewis's words, I fell into a familiar cycle:

**Guilt** → I'm not doing enough, I'm living in excess while others suffer

**Perfectionism** → I need to give everything! I need to completely change my lifestyle!

**Overwhelm** → I can't do that, it's impossible, I can't change everything at once

**Nothing** → I do nothing because I can't do everything

This cycle is insidious. Guilt without action becomes paralysis. Perfectionism becomes the enemy of good. I wait for the perfect moment, the perfect amount to give, the perfect plan, and in the meantime, I do nothing.

## Perfect Is the Enemy of Good

But during this reading of Mosiah 4, a thought came to me: I don't have to be perfect to start.

I cannot be perfect. My pride and my worldly desires are in the way. I cannot uproot them all at once. But what can I do? Something good, at least.

Joseph B. Wirthlin taught:

> "The [next] thing we can do to live in thanksgiving daily is open our arms. One of the best ways we show our gratitude is by blessing the lives of those around us. When was the last time you unselfishly reached out to help another in need? Every time we cheer another's heart, every time we ease another's burden, every time we lift a weary hand, we show our gratitude to that God to whom we owe all that we have and all that we are."

[Source: Joseph B. Wirthlin, "Live in Thanksgiving Daily" BYU Devotional 31 October 2000](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/joseph-b-wirthlin/live-in-thanksgiving-daily/)

Gratitude opens our arms. Remembering God's goodness to us makes us want to bless others. And I can start small.

## My 1% Commitment

I chose to start where my weakness allows: 1% of my income.

It's not perfect. It's probably not even "pinching" the way Lewis describes. But it's something. It's action instead of paralysis. It's good instead of perfect.

I created a 1% page on this blog where I track every donation I make and the claimed impact of those donations. It's my accountability tool, my way of saying "I'm doing something, even if it's imperfect."

This isn't the end goal. It's the starting line. But sometimes starting imperfectly is better than waiting forever to start perfectly.

## The Ongoing Transformation

King Benjamin's teaching is about transformation—the kind that starts with belief in God, grows through gratitude for His goodness, and manifests in opened hands toward those in need.

The personal changes (joy, love, remission of sins) lead to family changes (teaching our children truth and service) which lead to societal changes (caring for the poor and the beggar). It's a pattern that flows from the inside out, from the heart to the hands.

I'm still on this journey. My closet still has too many clothes. My charitable giving still doesn't pinch the way it probably should. But I'm not waiting for perfection anymore. I'm starting with 1%, with action, with something good.

Because in the end, Benjamin's question still stands: When the beggar puts up his petition to you, will you turn him away? Or will you remember that you too are a beggar before God, hoping for His mercy?

## Reflection

What could you start doing today, even imperfectly? Where does good triumph over perfect in your life?

# Two Kings, Two Towers: Inward vs. Outward Leadership



## Two Kings, Two Outcomes



The Book of Mormon gives us two kings who couldn't be more different: King Benjamin and King Noah.



Both held absolute power over their people. Both had resources at their disposal. Both built towers. Both left lasting legacies. But the similarities end there.



Benjamin's reign produced a people who experienced a mighty change of heart, became children of Christ, and enjoyed peace and prosperity. His legacy was a smooth transition to his son and eventually to a system of judges that would serve the people for generations.



Noah's reign produced vanity, oppression, and spiritual decay. His legacy was fragmentation, bondage, and eventually his own people burning him to death in fury.



What made the difference? Not their circumstances. Not their resources. Not even the challenges they faced.



The difference was their fundamental approach to leadership: **inward versus outward**.



Benjamin led outward, for the benefit of his people. Noah led inward, for the benefit of himself. And the fruit of each approach tells us everything we need to know about leadership in our own lives.



## Benjamin: Outward Leadership in Action



King Benjamin's philosophy of leadership is stated clearly in Mosiah 2:17:



> "When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God."



This wasn't just a nice sentiment. It was the operating principle of his entire reign. Benjamin saw his position of power not as a way to exercise authority, but as a way to spread the gospel and lift others up. He used his kingship as a platform for service, not for self-aggrandizement.



### Benjamin's Policies



His philosophy translated into concrete policies:



**No taxation or burden.** Benjamin explicitly states in Mosiah 2:14 that he "has not sought gold nor silver nor any manner of riches of you; Neither have I suffered that ye should be confined in dungeons, nor that ye should make slaves one of another, nor that ye should murder, or plunder, or steal, or commit adultery." He didn't burden his people with taxes to support a royal lifestyle.



**He worked with his own hands.** Mosiah 2:14 continues: "I, myself, have labored with mine own hands that I might serve you, and that ye should not be laden with taxes." The king (the highest authority in the land) worked alongside his people. This set the tone for the entire society: everyone worked, everyone contributed, and no one was above labor.



**He built a tower to serve.** When Benjamin knew his time as king was ending, he had a tower constructed. But not for himself, for his people. He built it so that everyone, even those far away, could hear his final words. The tower existed to make sure no one was left out, that every voice could reach his teaching.



**His final act was to give them a name.** Benjamin used his last moments of authority to bind his people to Christ, not to himself. He gave them the name "children of Christ" and helped them make covenants. Even at the end, with all the power and reverence they had for him, he pointed them to God.



### Benjamin's Outcomes



The fruit of Benjamin's outward leadership is stunning:



His people experienced a **mighty change of heart**. Mosiah 5:2 records: "The Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually." This wasn't superficial compliance. It was genuine transformation.



There was **unity and no contention**. Mosiah 2:4 notes there were "none that were contentious" among his people. When leadership serves rather than divides, people come together.



They enjoyed **economic prosperity and peace**. Because they weren't burdened with heavy taxation and their resources weren't extracted for a king's palace, families were cared for. The poor were treated better. Everyone gave to help each other.



His leadership created a **peaceful transition**. When Benjamin handed power to his son Mosiah, there was no upheaval, no crisis. The patterns Benjamin established continued, eventually leading to the transition from kings to judges, a system that would serve the Nephites for generations.



Benjamin's outward leadership created a society where people looked to him as an example of how to treat others. He built upward, lifting everyone together.



## Noah: Inward Leadership in Action



King Noah presents the opposite picture. While the Book of Mormon doesn't explicitly state his philosophy, his actions reveal it clearly: he believed his position existed for his personal benefit. Power was a tool for self-enrichment, not service.



### Noah's Policies



**20% taxation.** Mosiah 11:3 records that Noah "did tax them with heavy taxes, even to the fifth part of all they possessed." One-fifth of everything his people owned went to support his lifestyle. Compare this to Benjamin's explicit refusal to burden his people with taxes.



**Lavish personal construction.** Noah didn't build towers to teach. He built for display:

- A palace with "elegant and spacious buildings"

- "A throne in the midst thereof, all of which was of fine wood and was ornamented with gold and silver and with precious things"

- He even "ornamented the temple" - not to enhance worship, but to showcase wealth

- A tower from which to survey all his possessions (Mosiah 11:12)



**Corrupt priests who didn't work.** Mosiah 11:5-6 describes Noah's priests as "lazy and idolatrous" people who "did not support themselves by their own labors, but were supported by the taxes which king Noah had put upon his people." The burden wasn't just Noah. It was an entire administrative class living off the labor of others.



**Elimination of threats.** When the prophet Abinadi confronted Noah with truth, Noah killed him. Insecure leadership cannot tolerate challenge. Benjamin's security came from God; Noah's came from his position, which meant he had to protect it at all costs.



### Noah's Outcomes



The fruit of Noah's inward leadership was poisonous:



**Spiritual decay.** Mosiah 11:7 says plainly: "Yea, and thus they were supported in their laziness, and in their idolatry, and in their whoredoms, by the taxes which king Noah had put upon his people; thus did the people labor exceedingly to support iniquity." The moral rot started at the top and infected the whole society.



**Vanity and pride.** The people became focused on appearances, on being better than those around them, on finding power for themselves. They mirrored their king's values.



**Economic oppression.** While Noah lived in luxury, families struggled under the tax burden. Resources flowed inward to the king and his cronies, not outward to those in need.



**Fragmentation and bondage.** Noah's reign eventually fractured into two groups: Limhi's people (who fell into bondage to the Lamanites) and Alma's people (who fled to the wilderness and also eventually experienced bondage). His selfish leadership created generational trauma.



**His own people burned him.** In the end, Noah was burned by the very people he ruled. That's the ultimate indicator of failed leadership: when those you lead turn on you with such fury. They realized that Noah had never done anything to better their lives, only to leach from them.



Noah's inward leadership created a society where people feared him and his power. He built to elevate himself above others.



## The Two Towers: A Symbol



The towers that Benjamin and Noah built perfectly symbolize the difference in their leadership.



**Benjamin's tower** was built so everyone could hear him. It existed to serve, to ensure that even those far from the center could participate in his final teaching. It was a tool for inclusion, for making sure no one was left out. When people looked at Benjamin's tower, they saw an example of how to treat others: lift them up, make sure their voices are heard.



**Noah's tower** was built so he could survey all his possessions. Mosiah 11:12 says it was "built near the temple; yea, a very high tower, even so high that he could stand upon the top thereof and overlook the land of Shilom, and also the land of Shemlon." It existed to display his power, to remind everyone of what he owned, to elevate himself. When people looked at Noah's tower, they were meant to fear his reach and his control.



Same structure. Opposite purposes.



This illustrates the fundamental truth about leadership: **intent matters**. The same action (building a tower, teaching your children, leading a meeting, using your authority) can be service or self-promotion depending on what's driving it.



## The Self-Deception Problem



Here's what makes this challenging: we can deceive ourselves about our motives.



We can tell ourselves we're leading "outward" while actually leading "inward." We can genuinely believe we're serving others while subtly seeking personal gratification, validation, or recognition. The same actions can flow from different intents, and we're remarkably good at justifying our true motives to ourselves.



Consider the example of the "trophy child." A parent might say, "I want my child to succeed," but that statement can mean two very different things:



**Inward:** "I want my child to succeed so I feel like a successful parent, so I can display their achievements, so others think well of me."



**Outward:** "I want my child to develop their gifts and find joy, regardless of whether that looks like success to others or reflects well on me."



The actions might look similar from the outside. Both parents might push their children, invest in opportunities, celebrate achievements. But one is using the child to meet their own needs for validation (inward), while the other genuinely wants the child to flourish (outward). And eventually, the fruit will reveal which is which.



The child whose parent leads inward will feel like a performance, an extension of their parent's ego. The child whose parent leads outward will feel supported and loved for who they are, not what they achieve.



This pattern shows up everywhere:



**In church callings:** Do we lead to look good, to be seen as successful? Or to lift and serve those we're called to lead? Do we feel threatened when others have good ideas or when we're released from a calling?



**In marriage:** Do we serve our spouse to earn appreciation and validation? Or because we genuinely want their happiness and growth?



**At work:** Do we extract value for ourselves or create value for others? Do we hoard credit or share it? Do we see people as resources to advance our career or as people worthy of dignity?



The same actions (serving, leading, teaching) can flow from radically different motives. And we're often the last to recognize when our motives have shifted inward.



## The Fruit Test



So how do we know? If we can deceive ourselves about our motives, how do we actually discern whether we're leading inward or outward?



The answer is found in the fruit. Not just external metrics of success, but the internal state of those we lead.



### Questions to Ask



**Do the people I lead feel lifted or burdened?** Benjamin's people felt lifted, transformed, filled with joy. Noah's people felt burdened, oppressed, and eventually burned with rage.



**Are they growing or shrinking?** Are the people under your influence becoming more capable, more confident, more themselves? Or are they becoming smaller, more dependent, less secure?



**Do they experience joy or resentment?** Benjamin's people experienced a mighty change of heart. Noah's people experienced bondage and eventually burned him. Even in smaller contexts, do people light up when they see you coming, or do they brace themselves?



**Are they becoming more capable or more dependent on me?** Outward leadership empowers others to lead. Inward leadership requires everyone to orbit around you.



**What happens when I'm challenged?** Benjamin's humility allowed him to receive truth. Noah killed the prophet who challenged him. When someone disagrees with our leadership or offers a different perspective, do we feel threatened or curious?



The fruit doesn't lie. Benjamin's outward leadership produced joy, unity, mighty change, and a legacy of peace. Noah's inward leadership produced vanity, division, bondage, and his own violent end.



## The Response Test



Beyond examining the fruit in others' lives, we can examine our own responses to outcomes. This is perhaps the most revealing test.



**Ask yourself: How do I respond to outcomes?**



**The inward lens asks:**

- "How does this affect my image?"

- "What will people think of me?"

- "Does this make me look good or bad?"

- "Am I succeeding or failing?"



**The outward lens asks:**

- "How does this affect them?"

- "What do they need?"

- "Are they growing?"

- "How can I better serve?"



### Examples in Practice



**Your child achieves something:** Are you proud of *them* or proud of *yourself*? Do you immediately think about how this reflects on your parenting, or do you genuinely celebrate their growth and effort?



**Someone struggles under your leadership:** Do you worry about your failure as a leader, or do you genuinely hurt for their struggle and look for ways to help them succeed?



**You receive criticism or pushback:** Do you feel threatened (like Noah killing Abinadi), or are you open to learning and adjusting (like Benjamin's lifelong humility)?



**Someone else succeeds in your sphere:** Do you feel competitive or diminished, or do you genuinely celebrate their success?



**You're released from a position or someone else gets recognition:** Do you feel invisible or undervalued, or do you feel free to serve in new ways?



Our immediate, gut-level responses reveal more about our motives than our carefully crafted explanations ever will.



## Applications to Our Lives



We all lead *something*. Even if we're not kings or hold no formal position, we have spheres of influence. The question isn't whether we lead, but *how* we lead.



### In Families



Families are perhaps the easiest place to slip into inward leadership because the stakes feel so personal. Our children's behavior, achievements, and struggles all reflect on us, or at least, we think they do.



**The "family tax":** Do we burden our families with our needs, our schedules, our demands? Do our children exist to make our lives easier, to make us look good, to validate our parenting? Do we extract emotional labor from our spouse to manage our insecurities?



**Building towers:** Or do we build "towers" to serve them, making sure everyone in the family is heard, cared for, and able to reach their potential? Do we create structures (family time, traditions, conversations) that lift everyone up?



**The trophy trap:** Are we using our children to meet our own needs for validation? Do we push them into activities, achievements, or appearances that make *us* look good rather than helping *them* discover who they are?



The fruit test applies directly: Are your family members flourishing? Do they feel safe to be themselves? Are they growing in confidence and capability? Or do they feel like performances in your life story?



### In Church Callings



Church callings give us temporary stewardships where the temptation to lead inward can be subtle.



**Why are we serving?** To be seen as successful? To avoid the guilt of saying no? To earn respect? Or to genuinely bless the people in our stewardship?



**How do we respond to others' ideas?** If someone in our organization has a better idea than ours, can we celebrate it? Or do we subtly diminish it to protect our position as "the leader"?



**How do we feel about being released?** If we feel devastated, invisible, or forgotten when released, that might indicate we were serving for inward reasons: for the identity, recognition, or sense of importance the calling provided.



**Do we want credit?** When something goes well, do we make sure people know we were behind it? Or are we genuinely content to see others blessed, regardless of who gets credit?



Benjamin's outward leadership meant his final act was pointing people to Christ, not to himself. That's the model for every church calling.



### At Work and Other Stewardships



Even without formal authority, we lead through influence, collaboration, and how we treat others.



**Do we extract or create?** Do we see our job as extracting value for ourselves (salary, advancement, recognition), or as creating value for others (solving problems, serving customers, supporting teammates)?



**Do we hoard or share?** When we have knowledge, opportunities, or resources, do we hoard them to maintain our advantage, or share them to lift others?



**How do we treat people?** As resources to advance our agenda, or as people worthy of dignity and respect regardless of what they can do for us?



The fruit test still applies: Do people around you feel used or valued? Are they growing or surviving? Do they trust you or tolerate you?



## The Security Question



There's a deeper reason Benjamin could lead outward while Noah led inward: security.



Benjamin knew his power and worth came from God. Mosiah 2:11 records him saying, "I have not commanded you to come up hither that ye should fear me, or that ye should think that I of myself am more than a mortal man." He knew he was just a man serving God. His identity wasn't tied to his position as king.



This security freed him to serve. He didn't need to protect his image, defend his authority, or extract validation from his people. He could point them to Christ because his own worth wasn't on the line.



Noah's power came from his position. That's why he had to protect it at all costs. When Abinadi threatened his authority with truth, Noah killed him. When his people eventually turned on him, he had nothing left. His entire identity was bound up in being king, in having power, in being elevated above others.



**This is the key insight:** When we know our worth comes from God (when we understand that we're loved, valued, and secure regardless of what we accomplish or how others perceive us), we're free to lead outward. We can serve without needing something in return. We can empower others without feeling threatened. We can point people to Christ without needing them to admire us.



But when our worth comes from our position, our success, or others' approval, we become defensive. We have to protect our image. We lead inward because we're desperately trying to fill our own needs through our leadership.



The question is: Where does your security come from?



## The Generational Impact



The patterns we set don't just affect us. They impact the next generation.



Benjamin's servant leadership created peace for his son Mosiah and eventually enabled the transition from kings to judges. His outward approach built a system that didn't depend on one person, that empowered many leaders, that would serve the Nephites for generations. He created patterns of righteousness that rippled forward.



Noah's selfish leadership created bondage that his son Limhi spent years trying to escape. Limhi inherited not just a kingdom, but his father's debt—moral, spiritual, and political. The patterns of pride, vanity, and exploitation that Noah established infected his society and took generations to root out.



**The question we should ask ourselves:** If our children copy our leadership style (in their families, their callings, their work), what kind of leaders will they be?



Will they see leadership as service or as self-interest? Will they lift others or extract from them? Will they be secure enough to empower others, or insecure enough to need control?



The patterns we set matter. Not just for us, but for those who watch us and learn from us.



## The Choice: Inward or Outward?



At the end of King Benjamin's sermon, his people fell to the earth, viewed themselves as less than the dust, and cried out for the atoning blood of Christ to be applied to them. They experienced a mighty change. They became children of Christ. They covenanted together.



At the end of King Noah's reign, his people burned him in fury.



The difference wasn't intelligence, or circumstances, or resources. It was direction. One king's heart faced outward toward his people. The other's faced inward toward himself.



We make the same choice every day, in small moments:



- When our child interrupts us, do we respond with irritation (my time, my agenda) or patience (their need matters)?

- When someone in our organization struggles, do we worry about how it makes us look or genuinely seek to help them?

- When we have an opportunity to serve, do we calculate what we'll get in return or simply serve?

- When someone challenges our idea, do we defend our ego or consider their perspective?



Inward or outward. For ourselves or for others. Benjamin or Noah.



The fruit will tell the story.



And if we're honest with ourselves (if we look at the actual outcomes, the real responses, the genuine fruit), we'll know which direction we're facing.



The beautiful thing is, we can always turn. We can always choose, today, to lead outward. To serve rather than extract. To lift rather than use. To point to Christ rather than ourselves.



King Benjamin shows us it's possible. King Noah shows us what happens when we don't.

# Korihor's Blueprint: How to Destroy Faith in Four Steps



## The Pattern Hidden in Plain Sight



When I read Alma 30, I used to focus on the dramatic ending: Korihor struck dumb, trampled to death, a cautionary tale about opposing the truth. But I recently discovered something I'd never noticed before: Korihor's arguments aren't random rants. They follow a precise, strategic pattern.



If you take every argument Korihor makes and sort them into categories, something remarkable emerges. His attacks fall into four distinct groups, and they directly mirror, in exact order, the four principles of the doctrine of Christ: faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost.



This isn't coincidental. Korihor understood that to destroy the gospel, you attack it in the same sequence it's built. Each assault weakens the foundation for the next step. And once you see the pattern, you start recognizing it everywhere: in conversations with doubting friends, in social media arguments, in your own moments of spiritual struggle.



Let's examine Korihor's blueprint.



## Step 1: Attack Faith by Mocking Prophets



Korihor begins by undermining the very foundation of faith: the prophets and their teachings. Here's what he says:



- "Foolish traditions of your fathers" (Alma 30:14)

- "Silly traditions" (Alma 30:31)

- "Effect of a frenzied mind" (Alma 30:16)

- "Foolish and vain hope" (Alma 30:13)



Notice the language: *silly*, *foolish*, *outdated*. This isn't reasoned argument; it's mockery. And mockery is devastatingly effective because it appeals to something deep in human nature: our fear of looking foolish in front of others.



This reminds me of Lehi's dream, where people in the great and spacious building mock those walking the path to the tree of life. Some who've reached the tree, who've tasted the fruit, abandon it because they can't bear the scorn. The mocking doesn't have to be logical. It just has to make you feel embarrassed for believing.



**Why start with prophets?** Because for the people in the Book of Mormon, prophets were their spiritual leaders, the ones who taught them about God and His commandments. The people had to trust these leaders to embark on any spiritual journey. Today we have both prophets and scriptures filling this role. They teach us how to follow Christ. But if we don't have faith that what they're teaching is for our benefit, we'll never begin the journey of becoming like Christ.



Without trust in prophets and scripture, there's no foundation to build on. Everything else crumbles.



**The Modern Echo:** Today, we hear similar arguments: "The prophets are out of date on [insert issue]." "These teachings are just cultural artifacts." "Live your truth." That last phrase is particularly insidious because it sounds empowering, but it fundamentally contradicts the definition of truth given in the Doctrine and Covenants. It promotes a buffet-style gospel where we pick what we like and justify away the rest.



**The Antidote:** We must choose to invest in building our testimony and strengthen it to resist the mocking of the world. This isn't passive; it's active work, the kind Alma describes in chapter 32 when he talks about experimenting on the word.



## Step 2: Attack Repentance Through "Management of the Creature"



Once faith in prophets is undermined, Korihor moves to his second target: the need for Christ and repentance. His argument centers on what he calls "management of the creature":



- "Every man fared in this life according to the management of the creature" (Alma 30:17)

- "Every man prospers according to his genius, and every man conquers according to his strength"

- "Whatsoever a man did was no crime"



This is the doctrine of self-sufficiency. Success comes from how smart you are, how strong you are, how capable you are. You don't need Christ. You don't need grace. You're enough on your own.



**Why is this so effective?** Because it's flattering. It appeals to pride and the natural man described in Mosiah 3:19. It tells us what we want to hear: "You're sufficient. You're in control. Your problems are your own, but so are your successes." It removes accountability while inflating ego.



But here's the trap: if success is based entirely on our own management, then we also don't need to repent. If "whatsoever a man did was no crime," then there's no sin to turn from, no Savior needed, no grace required.



This teaching puts everything in our court and removes room for Christ and His atonement. And that effectively damns us, because we simply don't have the power to overcome sin on our own. We weren't meant to.



**The Modern Echo:** "Live your truth" returns here too, along with the prosperity gospel and the self-help culture that says you can manifest your own reality. The subtle message: you don't need God; you need to unlock your own potential.



**The Antidote:** Repentance requires humility: first to recognize we have a problem, then to rely on Christ to make the change. We need actual experiences with repentance where we see how the atonement works in our lives. Not theoretical understanding, but practical, personal application.



## Step 3: Attack Baptism by Claiming Priests Exploit You



Korihor's third assault is more aggressive. He doesn't just say the covenants are wrong; he claims the leaders are malicious:



- Priests "bind you down under foolish ordinances and performances" (Alma 30:23)

- They do this "to usurp power and authority over them, to keep them in ignorance"

- They "yoke you according to their desires"

- "Why do you yoke yourselves with such foolish things?" (Alma 30:13)



Notice the escalation. It's no longer "these traditions might be mistaken." It's "these leaders *know* it's false and are deliberately exploiting you for power."



**Why does this come third?** Because this attack only works after faith and repentance have been undermined. If you still trust prophets and believe you need Christ, you won't buy the claim that priesthood leaders are con artists. But once those foundations are shaken, this argument becomes plausible, even compelling.



If it were true that leaders knew their teachings were false and were using them just to gain power, then the moral thing to do would be rejecting their teachings and the society built on them. This would destroy not just individual faith, but the entire covenant community.



**The Modern Echo:** We see this in attacks on temple covenants, garments, and priesthood authority. The claim is always the same: "They're controlling you. These are tools of oppression. The church just wants your money and obedience."



**The Antidote:** We need to understand that covenants are for our benefit, not God's control. The ordinances aren't chains; they're the very tools that bind us to Christ and to each other. Following the teachings in Alma 32, we experiment on the word, trusting that God will provide and that we'll see the fruits of our obedience.



## Step 4: Attack the Holy Ghost by Demanding Signs



Korihor's final assault targets spiritual knowledge itself:



- "You cannot know of things which you do not see; therefore ye cannot know that there shall be a Christ" (Alma 30:15)

- "Show me a sign that I may be convinced" (Alma 30:43)

- "I will not believe" (Alma 30:48)



This is pure pride. Korihor demands that God prove Himself, and that *he* (Korihor) will judge whether the evidence is sufficient. He removes his own responsibility to seek, to ask, to knock. Instead, he puts the burden entirely on God: "Convince me, or I'm justified in my unbelief."



**The fundamental problem:** All of Korihor's teachings seem to circle back to pride. By demanding a sign, he avoids investing time in building a testimony and removes accountability for his actions. If he's wrong, it's God's job to fix it. Otherwise, he's in the right.



But here's what's tragic: even when Korihor gets his sign, being struck dumb by the power of God, it doesn't save him. The sign came too late. His heart was already hardened.



This reminds me of 3 Nephi 2, where people who'd seen the sign of Christ's birth began to forget, "imagining up some vain thing in their hearts, that it was wrought by men and by the power of the devil." They'd had their sign. But they changed the standard for what counted as evidence.



**The danger of intellectual-only testimony:** If our testimony is based purely on evidence, signs, or intellectual arguments rather than spiritual experiences, it becomes very fragile when life gets hard. The purpose of the gospel is to change our nature and desires. If we're only believing because of evidence, when that evidence becomes ambiguous or when someone offers a counter-argument, we're left unchanged, the same person we were before.



Standards can always be raised. No sign will ever be enough for someone determined not to believe.



**The Antidote:** Build spiritual experiences, not just intellectual ones. Learn to recognize and trust the Holy Ghost. Follow Alma's counsel to experiment on the word without expecting miraculous signs; trust the process of growth, even when it's slow.



## Why This Pattern Matters Today



Understanding Korihor's blueprint isn't just an academic exercise. It's practical spiritual defense.



When we recognize this pattern, we can see it playing out in real time: in our own doubts, in conversations with struggling friends, in the arguments we encounter online. The adversary uses the same playbook because it works. Each attack builds on the previous one. If you can spot it early, you can strengthen your defenses before the foundation erodes.



The same order that builds faith can be used systematically to destroy it:

1. Undermine trust in prophets and scripture

2. Eliminate the need for Christ and repentance  

3. Paint covenants as oppression

4. Demand impossible proof before believing



But we don't have to be passive victims. We can actively cultivate:

1. **Faith** - by studying and trusting prophets and scripture

2. **Repentance** - by practicing it regularly and seeing the atonement work

3. **Covenants** - by honoring them and experiencing their blessings

4. **The Holy Ghost** - by seeking spiritual experiences and learning to recognize His voice



## The Doctrine of Christ Stands



What strikes me most about Korihor's strategy is how precisely it mirrors what it's trying to destroy. The doctrine of Christ (faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost) is the pattern taught in 2 Nephi 31 and 3 Nephi 11. It's the foundation of everything.



Korihor knew this. So he attacked it systematically, in order, one principle at a time.



But here's what Korihor didn't understand: the doctrine of Christ isn't fragile. It's not a house of cards that collapses when challenged. It's the rock foundation that withstands every storm, *if we're actively building on it*.



The key word is *actively*. We can't passively hope our testimonies stay strong while we neglect them. We have to choose, daily, to invest in faith, to practice repentance, to honor covenants, and to seek the Spirit.



Korihor's blueprint shows us where the attacks will come. But it also shows us where to fortify our defenses.



Build on the rock. The pattern works.
